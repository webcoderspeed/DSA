### Introduction to C
  ---
  > C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language. It was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. C is a low-level programming language, which means that it can be used to write programs that directly interact with the computer's hardware, such as operating systems, device drivers, and embedded systems. C is also widely used for writing high-performance applications and is the foundation of many other programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python. Some of the key features of C include its simple syntax, powerful operators, and support for low-level programming.

#### Here is an example of a simple C program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:


```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```

> In this example, the #include <stdio.h> line includes the standard input/output library, which contains the printf() function that is used to print text to the console. The main() function is the entry point of the program and is where the code that runs when the program starts. Inside the main() function, the printf() function is used to print the text "Hello, World!" to the console. The return 0; statement at the end of the main() function indicates that the program has successfully completed.
