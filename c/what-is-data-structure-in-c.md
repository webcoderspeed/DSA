### What is Data Structure in C
---
> A data structure in C is a way of organizing and storing data in a program so that it can be efficiently accessed and manipulated. There are several different types of data structures in C, each with their own advantages and use cases. Some common data structures in C include

1) Array
2) Linked List
3) Stack 
4) Queue
5) Binary Tree
6) Binary Search Tree
7) Heap
8) Hashing 
9) Graph


#### In simple words
---
- Made up of 2 words
- “DATA” + “STRUCTURES”
- It is a way to arrange data in computers
- Example: You might want to store data in
- Linear fashion – Array/ Linked List
- One on the other – Stacks
- Hierarchical Fashion – Trees
- Connect nodes – Graph


### Classification of Data Structure
---
#### Data structures can be broadly classified into two categories:
1) Linear Data Structures: Linear data structures are those in which data elements are stored in a linear sequence, one after the other. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
2) Non-Linear Data Structures: Non-linear data structures are those in which data elements are not stored in a linear sequence. Instead, they are organized in a hierarchical or tree-like structure. Examples include trees, graphs, and hash tables.

### Another classification of data structures is based on the type of operations that can be performed on them:
1) Static Data Structures: Static data structures have a fixed size and cannot be modified during execution. Examples include arrays and structures.
2) Dynamic Data Structures: Dynamic data structures can change size during execution and can be modified as needed. Examples include linked lists and trees.
3) Homogeneous Data Structures: Homogeneous data structures are those in which all elements are of the same data type. Examples include arrays and linked lists.
4) Heterogeneous Data Structures: Heterogeneous data structures are those in which elements can be of different data types. Examples include trees and graphs.
